# OrderedArrayList
Summary of what our group discussed during class: 
- We actually spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to start. We tried to make an array list of T but couldn’t do it because we thought that we couldn’t import anything. Later, we realized that we must import ArrayList.
- We read the instructions together, the two parts we were supposed to complete, and realized that we could use super.
- We then read the three tricky parts you mentioned, and decided to maybe have an extra method like you suggested.
